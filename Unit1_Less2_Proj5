1.) What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
A1: The three longest trips are 85,900 seconds, 84,349 seconds, and 83,915 seconds. 
 
WITH
	rainy
AS(
	SELECT
		DATE(date) rain_date
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE events='Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
	)
SELECT 
	duration,
	trip_id,
	DATE(start_date)
FROM 
	trips 
JOIN
	rainy 
ON
	DATE(trips.start_date) = rainy.rain_date
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 3

2.)Which station is full most often?
A2: The station that is most full is the Santa Clara at Almaden station 

SELECT
	status.station_id,
	stations.name,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 then 1 END) full_count
FROM 
	status
JOIN
	stations
ON
	stations.station_id=status.station_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY full_count DESC

3.)Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

SELECT
	start_station,
	dockcount,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	stations
ON
	trips.start_station = stations.name
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY dockcount DESC


BONUS:(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

WITH rainy
AS(
	SELECT DATE(date) rain_date
	FROM weather
	WHERE events ='Rain'
	GROUP BY 1)
SELECT
	duration,
	DATE(start_date)
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	rainy
ON
	DATE(trips.start_date)=rainy.rain_date
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY duration DESC
